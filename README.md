Beeps and Boops
Program will change number inputs and give back "beep, boop, I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that"


Give examples
When pulling up the webpage it will show you a open text box. You will be asked to enter a number. If you enter a number with a "0 the response to it will be to replace the "0"with a "beep"

Say what the step will be

If the value has a "1" the response will be boop. This rule has presidence over the "0" entry. Number that are divisible by 3 will give the response "I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that"

Running the tests
This program will refresh and you will be able to continue to enter numbers
